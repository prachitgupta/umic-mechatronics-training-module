Assignment (4 days)

Fixed-Wing
Basic structure/parts (1 Day)
● What are you supposed to learn:
○ What are the various parts of an RC plane
○ How to control an RC plane while maneuvering
● Resources:
○ RC Plane document
○ Google Search

Aerodynamics (1 Week; in-sem)
● What are you expected to learn:
○ Decent understanding of various aerodynamic forces
○ Knowledge of various aerodynamic factors/phenomena.
○ Influence of different design parameters on the maneuver of the aircraft.
● Resources:
○ Aerodynamics Fundamentals (PDF):
Try to complete Basic Propeller Principles, i.e. till page no. 30, by the end
of 4 days as the later topics are more complex.

Aircraft Design (3 weeks)
● What are you expected to learn:
○ How to effectively design an aircraft.
○ What are the parameters taken into consideration?
● Resources:
○ RC Model Aircraft Design (PDF):
Daily 1 chapter till chapter no. excluding chapter no.
Week 1: Chapter 1-8
Week 2: Chapter 9-16
Week 3: Chapter 17-26
(Note: You can skip Chapter 22 and 23. You don’t need to focus on the portion of
the book that is not related to electrically powered planes.)
Doubts and Manufacturing: (1 Week)
● What is expected from you:
○ Clear all doubts what you have if remaining
○ Get an idea of feasible structures before cadding
● Resources:
○ Youtube and google search
Some videos for reference

Designing/ Assignment (2 Weeks)
● What are you expected to do:
○ You will be given some constraints and your task will be to design an RC
plane based on the knowledge you have acquired over the past 1 month.
